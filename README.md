# AQM-Robot-Code
The Arduino code files for the Air Quality Monitoring (AQM) robot prototype.

This repository contains the Arduino codes for the robotic prototype named AQM(Air Quality Monitoring) robot that measures
the concentration of certain types of polluting gases in the air and produces a real-time report.
The repository contains only the code for the arduino hardware used. Other parts of the project are not open sourced yet.
The codes are for the following modules:
1) **Gas Senssor Module Circuitry**
2) **RF Transmitter Module**
3) **RF Receiver Module**
